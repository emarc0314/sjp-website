    title: "We Stand Against Campus Closures: Support for Morales/Shakur Center at CCNY",
    date: "November 1, 2013",
    statement: "On Sunday October 20th, the administration of the City College of New York (part of the CUNY system) raided the Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur Student and Community Center, closing it off to students and community members and locking down the library during mid-terms week. The location has been a center for the activities of various organizations, such as the Revolutionary Student Coordinating Committee (RSCC), the Students for Educational Rights, Sister Circle Collective, the Black Student Union, and allowed community outreach throughout the Harlem community.\n\nThe next day the entire building was placed under lockdown. The University issued a statement saying that the Community space would now be designated as a Career Resource Center. Student belongings, including books and documents, were taken from the center to be held and “examined.”\n\nOn Thursday October 23rd the students held a very large sit-in to protest the center’s closure. The situation soon escalated and a CUNY alumnus was pepper sprayed and arrested.\n\nOn Monday October 28th the Office of Student Affairs banned two student leaders, both members of the RSCC, from The City College of New York campus. On November 25th, the Board of Trustees will vote on a so-called “Expressive Activities Policy,” which would further restrict the first amendment rights of students and faculty.\n\nCornell Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) condemn the actions of these administrators and the City College of New York police. We stand in solidarity with the RSCC, all the students of the City College of New York, and the larger Harlem community which has benefited from the Morales/Shakur Center.\n\nWe believe the actions of the CCNY/CUNY administration have seriously infringed the rights of students and the community to organize, and have intentionally disempowered students involved in vital anti-racist, anti-imperialist, and anti-rape organizing.\n\nWe insist upon the right of students to maintain independently-run spaces within THEIR university. We believe universities should be spaces of knowledge and exchange where each student can grow as a political actor and empower him or herself. We reject the vision of the university solely oriented towards careerism with no space for political dissent.\n\nWe oppose in the strongest possible terms the recent trend of militarization of the CUNY system and the clear attempt of CUNY administration to silence the voice of students and thereby violating their first amendment rights. Neither the CCNY police nor the NYPD have any place on campus. We support our fellow students at City College in their movement to stand up for themselves and their community and to reclaim the Morales/Shakur Center.\n\nUnited we will win!"

    title: "Cornell Community Denounces Collaboration with Technion University",
    date: "December 1, 2017",
    statement: "Dear Cornell Administration, \n\nWe, the undersigned, would like to represent our disappointment at Cornell Tech’s partnership with the Technion University in Israel. Below, we have laid out the reasons for our dissent and opposition to this partnership. \n\n More than any other university in Israel, the Technion, which is involved in the research and development of military and arms technology, is directly implicated in war crimes. Its joint programs with the Israeli military and its cooperative research programs with two of Israel’s major weapons corporations, Elbit and Rafael, renders Technion a full participant in the actions carried out by the Israeli military. Those actions include targeting civilians, as in the 2006 invasion of Lebanon and the 2008-2009 Cast Lead operation against Gaza, and physically contributing to Israel’s discriminatory practices in the West Bank with the construction of the separation wall that cuts sharply into the occupied West Bank and disrupts the lives of Palestinians in countless ways. \n\n Cornell administration cannot plead ignorance of these facts. Rafael Advanced Defense Systems LTD., which established a three-year ‘in-house’ MBA program at Technion University, has worked with students and faculty there to develop the ‘Ramtech’ rockets and different unmanned aircraft to be used in Israel’s ongoing occupation. Rafael also developed the armor used by the Merkava-4-tanks, which enabled the Israeli military forces to carry out urban warfare, as they did during the Cast Lead operation. In the course of that warfare, actions were taken that constitute war crimes under international law. We are extremely disappointed at Cornell’s decision to collaborate with this. Elbit Systems, which established a training program for engineers in the Technion and has given research grants to Technion consisting of half a million US dollars a year for 5 years, is one of the two main contractors for Israel’s separation wall- which has been declared illegal by the international Court of Justice- and is the producer of the deadlier incidents during the 2006 war against Lebanon and the 2008-2009 attacks on Gaza. \n\n Human Rights Watch has condemned Israel’s use of drones for targeted killings. Such killings have prompted Amnesty International to call for suspension of UK arms sales to Israel. Technion is very obviously complicit in these killings. \n\n Institutional links with Technion will, furthermore, result in complicity in the unjust treatment of Israeli-Palestinians. At every level of the Israeli educational system, Israeli-Palestinian students encounter obstacles in terms of access to many programs- especially the ones tied to participation in the IDF- as well as to housing and resources. Beyond these pervasive structural inequalities, freedom of speech for Palestinian-Israelis is curtailed at Technion. For example, in the first few days of June 2010, in the wake of Israel’s attack on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, a pro-military student’s group was permitted to demonstrate, while the mostly Palestinian led rally against the attack was repressed brutally by the police and several demonstrators were arrested. Severe restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly for Palestinian students at Technion are part of a broader colonial and racist educational system, one that is integral to Israeli occupation. The proposed partnership with an institution like the Technion would not uphold Cornell’s founding values of universalism and inclusion embodied in the university’s motto “any person any study, nor would it comply with President Pollack’s continuous advocacy for the right of free speech. \n\n  We do not and will not lend our voices to this collaboration with an Israeli institute that facilitates war crimes. We refuse to be implicated in war crimes and we reject any attempt to normalize them. We refuse to collaborate with this, and call on you, the Cornell Administration, to end the partnership with Technion! \n\n Signed Cornell Students for Justice in Palestine, Islamic Alliance for Justice, Amnesty International at Cornell University, The Cornell South Asian Council, Cornell Organization for Labor Action, Cornell Welcomes Refugees, Cornell Pakistani Students Association, Ordinary People, Cornell Dream Team"

    title: "Call to Withhold Participation in Amos Yadlin’s HKS Study Group",
    date: "March 6, 2022",
    statement: "To the Harvard Kennedy School student body and other Harvard affiliates, \n\n We, members of the Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine (HOOP) campaign, strongly urge all accepted students to turn down their spot for MEI Senior Fellow Amos Yadlin’s Spring 2022 Study Group, entitled “Israeli National Security in a Shifting Middle East: Historical and Strategic Perspectives for an Uncertain Future.” \n\n As a retired Major General of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and Chief of the Military Intelligence Directorate, Yadlin’s career has actively upheld Israel’s colonial and illegal occupation over the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel has been condemned by numerous Palestinian and international organizations for committing apartheid, a crime against humanity according to international law. Harvard’s willingness to invite Yadlin as a senior fellow not only normalizes Israeli war crimes, but also promotes the erasure of indigenous Palestinian narratives, by ignoring the past history and present reality of ethnic cleansing and settler colonialism in Palestine. Furthermore, the “national security” framing of the study group sanitizes Israel’s violence as an occupier, and platforms a colonial military general in an academic space, leaving unquestioned how the language of 'national security' in Israel justifies the control and killing of Palestinians.  \n\n The HOOP campaign calls on all students to withdraw from this study group, to deplatform Yadlin’s troubling presence and pressure Harvard to reconsider its support for institutions that promote harm and violence.

    statement: "We grieve the loss of life that has taken place in recent days. Cornell Students for Justice in Palestine stands firmly committed to upholding human rights for all people. We support all resistance against colonial entities and military occupation while standing opposed to killing civilians and non-military personnel. \n\n The events in the past few days have been a direct result of ongoing Israeli military occupation and a system of subjugation, where millions of Palestinians in Gaza are routinely massacred and forced to live in an open-air prison with the vast majority of them being refugees displaced by Israel. \n\n Israel has cut off electricity, food, water and fuel to the 2.3 million Palestinians that live in Gaza, and it is evident that its goal is to further dehumanize, subjugate, and displace Palestinians. \n\n  We, Cornell SJP, call on Cornell to end its ties with Israel’s war machine and reiterate our commitment to boycott, divest, and sanction until Israel’s system of apartheid ceases to exist. We demand a nation that upholds the human rights of all citizens regardless of religion, race, or ethnicity. Lastly, we ask that all Cornellians keep the people of Palestine in their thoughts as Israel continues its nondiscriminatory onslaught in Gaza, and suffocates their civilians under a draconian air, sea, and land military blockade.

    date: "October 30, 2023",
    statement: "Cornell Students for Justice in Palestine condemns the vile Anti-Semitic and Islamophobic messages that threaten Cornell’s Jewish and Muslim students. As an organization, we vehemently oppose all forms of discrimination or bigotry that endangers, defames, or dehumanizes anyone. We implore Cornell University to protect its students and provide comprehensive protection against all types of biases for its students. \n\n While the originator of these messages remains anonymous, the efforts from various actors to stoke fear and division have given rise to an exceptionally tense and challenging atmosphere. This impacts students and activists alike, whose identities are most prominently displayed. It’s essential to emphasize that Anti-Semitism will never be part of the Free Palestine Movement and that the messages posted utilized violent and Islamophobic terms that run contrary to the principles of Islam to create a hateful and threatening environment on Campus. We call on Cornell University to conduct a thorough investigation to identify the individual responsible for these hateful comments and ensure they are held accountable. \n\n Cornell’s Coalition for Mutual Liberation Condemns Anti-Semitism \n\n The undersigned organizations, which represent a broad-based coalition on campus, entirely and utterly condemn the vile anti-semitic messages that have threatened Cornell’s Jewish Community. We stand firmly against any form of discrimination that sets out to endanger, defame, or dehumanize anyone. We call upon Cornell to protect the Jewish Community and conduct a thorough and complete investigation and we hope that the responsible party answers for these dangerous posts. We want to emphasize that these statements are contrary to the religious teachings of Islam and all major religions. \n\n Anti-semitism and Anti-semitic individuals are not part of our liberation movement. We unequivocally denounce the racist confounding of Jewish identity with the actions of the state of Israel. Any action to the contrary that endangers the well-being of Jewish students at Cornell does not align with our shared beliefs. Liberation necessitates protecting all people regardless of ethnicity, religion, gender, and sexuality. It is on these grounds that we protest for the rights of oppressed Palestinian people in Gaza in the face of brutal occupation with genocidal consequences. We want to reiterate that the comments made are not sanctioned by Cornell’s Coalition for Mutual Liberation and do not represent our membership. \n\n As tensions on campus continue to rise, we call on the administration to safeguard all students equally. Protection from doxxing and other forms of intimidation must be dealt with the same vigor that free speech is defended. We invite all members of our Cornell community to attend subsequent teach-ins that aim to ensure a commitment to academic rigor and accuracy. \n\n Signed Cornell’s Coalition for Mutual Liberation, Cornell’s Collective for Justice in Palestine, Students for Justice in Palestine, Arab Graduate Student Association, Black Graduate Professional Student Association, Muslim Educational and Cultural Association, Cornell Muslim Life, Black Students United, The Cadre Journal"

    statement: "We want to extend our unwavering support and solidarity to our freshman Muslim sister who was spat at. This attack further illustrates the harm and dangers faced by those in our Muslim and Arab communities, specifically Muslim women who wear the hijab. \n\n This degrading attack towards Arabs of any religious denomination is a continuation of a climate that Cornell fosters. Cornell has consistently demonstrated that the safety of students of color are left wanting. This is not the first time Arab/Muslim students have been targeted. This attack is the latest in a series of targeted attacks/provocations at those who are perceived to be Pro-Palestinian. \n\n Here is a brief timeline of additional attacks/provocations that have gone publicly unaddressed by Cornell Administration despite repeated outreach. This is NOT an exhaustive list of incidents. \n\n October 29: The same day as the anti-semitic death threats were posted in Greekrank and Other Platforms, death threats were made targeting Arab and Muslim students. We were privately told these were under investigation. To date, there has been no follow up or public statement issues. \n\n An article titled “Posts Online Threaten Jewish Students and Center for Jewish Living” released by Cornell daily Sun wrote, “There have also been several derogatory posts towards Muslim students on campus posted on the Greekrank platform on Sunday. One post, published under the name, “glory to hamas,” threatened to “bring many ak 47 [sic] and slave women in hijab to make party [sic] more fun!” \n\n Early November, 2023: Weill Cornell leader pushes for deportation of US students peacefully protesting. \n\n Evelyn Horn, Director of the Perkin Heart Failure Center of Weill Cornell, reposted a LinekdIn post by Israeli economist, Eugene Kandel, in which he supported a poster that said “Exchange each hostage for 100 Pro-Hamas US students. Good for Israel, good for USA, good for Hamas, EDUCATIONAL FOR STUDENTS.” To this Kandel’s post added, “Interesting idea. Out of the box. This exchange can even be offered as an extra-credit activity in popular courses on anti-colonialism at universities, and the trip supervised by their instructors. Any takers?” \n\n November 2023: Muslim students were recorded leaving Anabel Taylor Hall after Friday prayer service by a previously identified counte protestor. \n\n December 4: A threatening email was sent to the Pan-African Muslim Student Association. \n\n An email with the subject line, “Hamas collaborators’ death penalty” wrote, “Students nazis are convicted to mass rapes and beheadings by hamas nazis. Shma Israel, f*ck devil allah and satan muham-mad!”"
